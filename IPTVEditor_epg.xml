The first and last word in each chain are revealed, and the contestants must guess the missing words, with one letter being revealed each turn. Each link in the chain forms a compound word or phrase with the word before and/or after it. Teams earn money for each word they guess correctly, and the team with the most money at the end of the game goes on to the bonus round, dubbed the Super Chain, for a chance to add an additional $5,000 to the total the team won during the main part of the game.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717220000 +0000" stop="20250717223000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717223000 +0000" stop="20250717230000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717230000 +0000" stop="20250717233000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Tic Tac Dough</title><desc>Two contestants compete to place three marks in a row on trivia board avoiding a dragon that can steal turns; the winner faces the dragon in a final round where it blocks three-in-a-row attempts to prevent the $10,000 prize win.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717233000 +0000" stop="20250718000000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Bingo Blitz</title><desc>Contestants compete in a dynamic blend of trivia and bingo.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718000000 +0000" stop="20250718010000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>The Wall</title><desc>Two cousins vie for the prize.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718010000 +0000" stop="20250718020000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Press Your Luck</title><desc>Contestants from Sri Lanka, Oxnard, Calif., and Chicago, Ill.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718020000 +0000" stop="20250718023000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718023000 +0000" stop="20250718030000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718030000 +0000" stop="20250718033000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718033000 +0000" stop="20250718040000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718040000 +0000" stop="20250718043000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718043000 +0000" stop="20250718050000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Flip Side</title><desc>The hilarious new survey game show explores answers to questions from differing perspectives; host Jaleel White.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718050000 +0000" stop="20250718053000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Wheel of Fortune</title><desc>In a classic game-show version of &quot;Hangman,&quot; contestants solve word puzzles for cash and prizes.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718053000 +0000" stop="20250718060000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Switch</title><desc>Jeff Hephner challenges contestants who are ranked based on their answers to trivia questions for a chance at $10,000; every question counts, as each answer can propel them to the top or to the bottom, where they&apos;ll be in jeopardy of elimination.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718060000 +0000" stop="20250718063000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>People Puzzler</title><desc>Three contestants put their pop culture knowledge to the test to complete crosswords based on the iconic puzzles in People magazine.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718063000 +0000" stop="20250718070000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718070000 +0000" stop="20250718073000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718073000 +0000" stop="20250718080000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Stapleton Family vs. Fountain Family.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718080000 +0000" stop="20250718083000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Freedom to Leave the House!

This is the story of the handful of determined men and women who mobilized to save the ones that were left in a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction. Ranchers like Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight rescued orphaned buffalo calves and built small herds. Former buffalo hunters like Buffalo Bill helped build public sympathy. And politicians like Theodore Roosevelt helped pass laws to protect the remaining animals. The effort would be a generational one, with buffalo herds carefully tended, bred, and passed down to new stewards when their old protectors passed away.

If a player finishes the second round with zero dollars, they are eliminated from &quot;Final Jeopardy.&quot; The first version of &quot;Jeopardy!,&quot; which aired from 1964 to 1975 on NBC, was hosted by Art Fleming. Alex Trebek is the current host; he began with the program in 1984 (at the start of its syndicated run).</desc></programme><programme start="20250717200000 +0000" stop="20250717203000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Master Minds</title><desc>Three challengers take on some of the great minds in trivia in a showdown of smarts and strategy; the last contestant standing will face off against the highest scoring Master Mind in a head-to-head battle.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717203000 +0000" stop="20250717210000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>America Says</title><desc>Game show series have been making a comeback in television, and media and &quot;America Says&quot; is no exception.

The premise is simple: two teams try to complete chains of seven words. The first and last word in each chain are revealed, and the contestants must guess the missing words, with one letter being revealed each turn. Each link in the chain forms a compound word or phrase with the word before and/or after it. Teams earn money for each word they guess correctly, and the team with the most money at the end of the game goes on to the bonus round, dubbed the Super Chain, for a chance to add an additional $5,000 to the total the team won during the main part of the game.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717220000 +0000" stop="20250717223000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717223000 +0000" stop="20250717230000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717230000 +0000" stop="20250717233000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Tic Tac Dough</title><desc>Two contestants compete to place three marks in a row on trivia board avoiding a dragon that can steal turns; the winner faces the dragon in a final round where it blocks three-in-a-row attempts to prevent the $10,000 prize win.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717233000 +0000" stop="20250718000000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Bingo Blitz</title><desc>Contestants compete in a dynamic blend of trivia and bingo.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718000000 +0000" stop="20250718010000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>The Wall</title><desc>Two cousins vie for the prize.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718010000 +0000" stop="20250718020000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Press Your Luck</title><desc>Contestants from Sri Lanka, Oxnard, Calif., and Chicago, Ill.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718020000 +0000" stop="20250718023000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718023000 +0000" stop="20250718030000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718030000 +0000" stop="20250718033000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718033000 +0000" stop="20250718040000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718040000 +0000" stop="20250718043000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718043000 +0000" stop="20250718050000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Flip Side</title><desc>The hilarious new survey game show explores answers to questions from differing perspectives; host Jaleel White.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718050000 +0000" stop="20250718053000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Wheel of Fortune</title><desc>In a classic game-show version of &quot;Hangman,&quot; contestants solve word puzzles for cash and prizes.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718053000 +0000" stop="20250718060000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Switch</title><desc>Jeff Hephner challenges contestants who are ranked based on their answers to trivia questions for a chance at $10,000; every question counts, as each answer can propel them to the top or to the bottom, where they&apos;ll be in jeopardy of elimination.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718060000 +0000" stop="20250718063000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>People Puzzler</title><desc>Three contestants put their pop culture knowledge to the test to complete crosswords based on the iconic puzzles in People magazine.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718063000 +0000" stop="20250718070000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718070000 +0000" stop="20250718073000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718073000 +0000" stop="20250718080000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Stapleton Family vs. Fountain Family.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718080000 +0000" stop="20250718083000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Freedom to Leave the House!

But in the late 1800s, the nation&apos;s buffalo were nearly wiped out by ruthless hide hunters. Those majestic herds, which once numbered in the tens of millions, were down to less than 500 animals. This is the story of the handful of determined men and women who mobilized to save the ones that were left in a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction. Ranchers like Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight rescued orphaned buffalo calves and built small herds. Former buffalo hunters like Buffalo Bill helped build public sympathy. And politicians like Theodore Roosevelt helped pass laws to protect the remaining animals. The effort would be a generational one, with buffalo herds carefully tended, bred, and passed down to new stewards when their old protectors passed away. Thanks to their efforts, there are an estimated 500,000 buffalo thundering across America&apos;s grasslands once again.</desc></programme><programme start="20250720220000 +0000" stop="20250720234200 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Christmas in the Smokies</title><desc>Clinging to the only life she&apos;s ever known, a headstrong woman (along with her loving parents) finds herself on the verge of losing her family&apos;s berry farm in the heart of the Smoky Mountains, to an impending retail expansion.

But in the late 1800s, the nation&apos;s buffalo were nearly wiped out by ruthless hide hunters. Those majestic herds, which once numbered in the tens of millions, were down to less than 500 animals. This is the story of the handful of determined men and women who mobilized to save the ones that were left in a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction. Ranchers like Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight rescued orphaned buffalo calves and built small herds. Former buffalo hunters like Buffalo Bill helped build public sympathy. And politicians like Theodore Roosevelt helped pass laws to protect the remaining animals. The effort would be a generational one, with buffalo herds carefully tended, bred, and passed down to new stewards when their old protectors passed away. Thanks to their efforts, there are an estimated 500,000 buffalo thundering across America&apos;s grasslands once again.</desc></programme><programme start="20250721100000 +0000" stop="20250721120000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Christmas in the Smokies</title><desc>Clinging to the only life she&apos;s ever known, a headstrong woman (along with her loving parents) finds herself on the verge of losing her family&apos;s berry farm in the heart of the Smoky Mountains, to an impending retail expansion.
