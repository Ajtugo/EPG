Looking to offload their new herd, the guys head down to the local stockyard to hone their bartering skills. Cody bounces a crazy rodeo idea off the boys - then uses them guinea pigs. Bubba plans a short getaway with Kaley, but there&apos;s a big catch: Booger&apos;s been tapped as the babysitter, with Jaclyn lending a helping hand. Kaley wonders if Booger is up to the challenge. His first attempts to feed and dress little Andie suggest he most certainly is not! While Bubba and Kaley aren&apos;t sure they&apos;ll return home to find everything in one piece, they do get some great news from houseguest Andrew. Cody is desperate to find the final missing piece for his rodeo: an announcer.

Andrew&apos;s bags are finally packed and he&apos;s clearing out. Though Bubba and Kaley hate to see him go, they also love watching him leave! Since the cowboys have been buying cattle left and right, word&apos;s gotten out about the Faith Cattle Company&apos;s trading business. This leads to Booger and Bubba boarding a private jet to meet some Texas investors looking to place a make-or-break order. As the guys hustle to gather all the cattle in time, they find themselves bidding against an old friend at the sale barn. Rodeo night brings all the families together - and even Andrew makes a surprise appearance. As the season draws to a close, the cowboys have everything on the line: their own money, as well as their reputations.</desc></programme><programme start="20251001060000 +0000" stop="20251001063000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Rifleman</title><desc>S1 E33 The Money Gun Lucas has a disdain for Oat Jackford since years ago he burned down his ranch to get him off property he wanted.

Leaving Fort Mandan after their first winter on the frontier, the Corps of Discovery enters completely uncharted territory.
