Leaving Fort Mandan after their first winter on the frontier, the Corps of Discovery enters completely uncharted territory.

To communicate with the elusive tribe, they rely on Sacagawea, a 16-year-old Shoshone woman, who accompanies the expedition with her newborn son. Lewis and Clark hope Sacagawea will help them trade for the Shoshone&apos;s horses, which will provide the only means of crossing the forbidding Rocky Mountains before winter returns.</desc></programme><programme start="20241231230000 +0000" stop="20250101000000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Into The Wild Frontier</title><desc>S1 E1 John Colter: King of the Mountain Men
As a member of Lewis and Clark&apos;s Corps of Discovery, John Colter travels from the Missouri River all the way to the Pacific Ocean, but he decides not to return to the civilized East when the expedition ends.

As a fur trapper, hunter, scout, and explorer, Kit Carson is an irresistible subject for reporters and novelists, and his incredible adventures make him a mythic figure in his own lifetime. Yet fame is the last thing on Carson&apos;s mind in 1849. All he wants to do is settle down to a quiet life with his wife on the family ranch, but once again fate comes calling. When settler Ann White is captured by an Apache raiding party, the Army seeks out Carson to help track the warriors and rescue Mrs. White, whose husband was killed in the raid. Although known to be the best tracker in the history of the Western Frontier, Carson admits this is the most difficult trail he has ever followed. He leads the military on a desperate chase, tracking the Apache through 200 miles of treacherous western wilderness. When they finally catch up with the Apache, the aftermath leaves Carson haunted for the rest of his days.</desc></programme><programme start="20250104110000 +0000" stop="20250104120000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Into The Wild Frontier</title><desc>S2 E8 William Sublette: King of the Fur Trade

As a fur trapper, hunter, scout, and explorer, Kit Carson is an irresistible subject for reporters and novelists, and his incredible adventures make him a mythic figure in his own lifetime. Yet fame is the last thing on Carson&apos;s mind in 1849. All he wants to do is settle down to a quiet life with his wife on the family ranch, but once again fate comes calling. When settler Ann White is captured by an Apache raiding party, the Army seeks out Carson to help track the warriors and rescue Mrs. White, whose husband was killed in the raid. Although known to be the best tracker in the history of the Western Frontier, Carson admits this is the most difficult trail he has ever followed. He leads the military on a desperate chase, tracking the Apache through 200 miles of treacherous western wilderness. When they finally catch up with the Apache, the aftermath leaves Carson haunted for the rest of his days.</desc></programme><programme start="20250103230000 +0000" stop="20250104000000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Into The Wild Frontier</title><desc>S2 E8 William Sublette: King of the Fur Trade
