But in the late 1800s, the nation&apos;s buffalo were nearly wiped out by ruthless hide hunters. Those majestic herds, which once numbered in the tens of millions, were down to less than 500 animals. This is the story of the handful of determined men and women who mobilized to save the ones that were left in a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction. Ranchers like Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight rescued orphaned buffalo calves and built small herds. Former buffalo hunters like Buffalo Bill helped build public sympathy. And politicians like Theodore Roosevelt helped pass laws to protect the remaining animals. The effort would be a generational one, with buffalo herds carefully tended, bred, and passed down to new stewards when their old protectors passed away. Thanks to their efforts, there are an estimated 500,000 buffalo thundering across America&apos;s grasslands once again.</desc></programme><programme start="20250829200000 +0000" stop="20250829202800 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Wild West Chronicles</title><desc>S4 E12 The Battle of Stone Corral When bandits rob a train and gun down a pursuing marshal, they spark one of the largest manhunts in California history.

But in the late 1800s, the nation&apos;s buffalo were nearly wiped out by ruthless hide hunters. Those majestic herds, which once numbered in the tens of millions, were down to less than 500 animals. This is the story of the handful of determined men and women who mobilized to save the ones that were left in a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction. Ranchers like Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight rescued orphaned buffalo calves and built small herds. Former buffalo hunters like Buffalo Bill helped build public sympathy. And politicians like Theodore Roosevelt helped pass laws to protect the remaining animals. The effort would be a generational one, with buffalo herds carefully tended, bred, and passed down to new stewards when their old protectors passed away. Thanks to their efforts, there are an estimated 500,000 buffalo thundering across America&apos;s grasslands once again.</desc></programme><programme start="20250830080000 +0000" stop="20250830082800 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Wild West Chronicles</title><desc>S4 E12 The Battle of Stone Corral When bandits rob a train and gun down a pursuing marshal, they spark one of the largest manhunts in California history.

As a hunter, trapper and explorer in his own right, he&apos;s the first American to see the Grand Tetons and the epic Yellowstone Valley. While his epic explorations make him famous, it&apos;s a harrowing ordeal with Blackfeet warriors that makes him a legend. After boldly venturing into territory controlled by the Blackfeet tribe, Colter is captured, stripped naked, and forced to run for his life as warriors give chase in what will come to be known as Colter&apos;s Run.</desc></programme><programme start="20250831090000 +0000" stop="20250831092800 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Wild West Chronicles</title><desc>S1 E7 Wild Bill Hickok &amp; the First Quick-Draw Duel Wild Bill Hickok and his buddy, Davis Tutt, see their friendship fall apart over gambling debts and the affections of a beautiful woman. After Tutt swipes Wild Bill&apos;s prized timepiece as payback for a disputed debt, things begin to heat up. Then, when Tutt parades through town with the watch in one hand and Hickok&apos;s former girlfriend in the other, Wild Bill&apos;s blood begins to boil. Tutt refuses to return the watch, and he continues to flaunt the beautiful woman on his arm. The two men meet in the middle of town to settle their differences once and for all in what will become the very first quick-draw duel of the Old West. Both men reach for their pistols at the same time and fire! In an attempt to separate the truth from the fiction, Bat Masterson, legendary gunfighter-turned-newspaperman, interviews George Ward Nichols, the journalist who immortalized the duel and created the legend of Wild Bill Hickok.</desc></programme><programme start="20250831092800 +0000" stop="20250831100000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Wild West Chronicles</title><desc>S1 E8 Dr. Susan Anderson: Frontier Medicine Woman Freshly-graduated from medical school, Dr. Susan Anderson sets up a practice in Cripple Creek, Colorado, a rough-and-tumble mining town. At a time when only ten percent of physicians are female, Dr. Anderson faces her share of doubters and has a difficult time attracting patients in the frontier town. When miners suddenly rush into her office with an injured boy, she defies prevailing wisdom and decides to save his mangled arm instead of amputating the limb. The risks are enormous. If the boy&apos;s arm becomes infected, and he dies, she will lose everything. Years later, Dr. Anderson relives the story while treating Bat Masterson, legendary gunfighter-turned-newspaperman, who comes down with fever while passing through Cripple Creek.</desc></programme><programme start="20250831100000 +0000" stop="20250831110000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Cheyenne</title><desc>S6 E5 Day&apos;s Pay Cheyenne arrives in a town held hostage by a gang of bandits.
