which recounts stories of people&apos;s deadly ordeals in the outdoors. Accompanying survivors back to where harrowing events occurred is rock-climber Craig DeMartino, who is featured in the premiere episode. His right leg was amputated below the knee after a climbing accident, but he continued in his sport. In 2006 he became the first amputee to free-climb the 3,200-foot face of Yosemite&apos;s El Capitan in one day. Other stories tell of sailor Steven Callahan clinging to a raft in the Atlantic, fisherman Dean Ririe trapped by a boulder in icy water, and hiker Ted Porter falling into a glacial crevasse.</desc></programme><programme start="20240930100000 +0000" stop="20240930110000 +0000" channel="aweplus.us"><title lang="en">Dream Cruises</title><desc lang="en">A look at what are considered to be some of the best cruises in the world.</desc></programme><programme start="20240930110000 +0000" stop="20240930113000 +0000" channel="aweplus.us"><title lang="en">Travel in Style</title><desc lang="en">&quot;Travel in Style&quot;
