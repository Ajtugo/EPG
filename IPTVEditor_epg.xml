Lance Caldwell (Rock Hudson) is sent to Fort King in Florida to serve under Maj. Harlan Degan (Richard Carlson), who wants to rid the area of the Native American Seminole tribe. This plan sits poorly with Caldwell, whose childhood friend -- and rival in his pursuit of the lovely Revere Muldoon (Barbara Hale) -- is the tribe&apos;s chief, Osceola (Anthony Quinn). Tension between the Seminole and the army rises, and, when a guard is killed at the fort, the lieutenant is blamed for the murder.</desc></programme><programme start="20241123210000 +0000" stop="20241123220000 +0000" channel="insp.us"><title>The Young Riders</title><desc>With the Civil War looming, Cody enlists as a Union scout.</desc></programme><programme start="20241123220000 +0000" stop="20241123230000 +0000" channel="insp.us"><title>The Young Riders</title><desc>Hickok and the Kid brawl, and Lou and the Kid marry.</desc></programme><programme start="20241123230000 +0000" stop="20241123233000 +0000" channel="insp.us"><title>The Rifleman</title><desc>A gunman threatens to kill Micah and Lucas tries to help.</desc></programme><programme start="20241123233000 +0000" stop="20241124000000 +0000" channel="insp.us"><title>The Rifleman</title><desc>Lucas is accused of murder by a man who claims to be an eyewitness.</desc></programme><programme start="20241124000000 +0000" stop="20241124010000 +0000" channel="insp.us"><title>Gunsmoke</title><desc>A wandering trail hand attempts to leave Dodge City with the fiancee of his friend.</desc></programme><programme start="20241124010000 +0000" stop="20241124020000 +0000" channel="insp.us"><title>Gunsmoke</title><desc>Doc Adams attempts the difficult task of rehabilitating a longtime alcoholic.</desc></programme><programme start="20241124020000 +0000" stop="20241124034600 +0000" channel="insp.us"><title>Law and Order</title><desc>Wild West lawman Frame Johnson (Ronald Reagan) arrests a notorious outlaw, but, after the locals threaten to break into the prison and hang the crook without a trial, Frame gets fed up with injustice.
