Leaving Fort Mandan after their first winter on the frontier, the Corps of Discovery enters completely uncharted territory.

Leaving Fort Mandan after their first winter on the frontier, the Corps of Discovery enters completely uncharted territory. But as the waterways they travel become too shallow for boats, Lewis and Clark desperately seek the Shoshone tribe and their horses.
