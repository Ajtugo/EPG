Now down to ten cowboys, the competition continues with an all-new immunity challenge that focuses on a whole different aspect of cowboyin&apos; - business acumen.

Trace asks the contestants to continue to train the colts from the last elimination challenge, but they struggle to develop a plan that will work for everyone.

As the competition intensifies, one cowboy tries to get rid of his biggest competition.

The first and last word in each chain are revealed, and the contestants must guess the missing words, with one letter being revealed each turn. Each link in the chain forms a compound word or phrase with the word before and/or after it. Teams earn money for each word they guess correctly, and the team with the most money at the end of the game goes on to the bonus round, dubbed the Super Chain, for a chance to add an additional $5,000 to the total the team won during the main part of the game.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717220000 +0000" stop="20250717223000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717223000 +0000" stop="20250717230000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717230000 +0000" stop="20250717233000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Tic Tac Dough</title><desc>Two contestants compete to place three marks in a row on trivia board avoiding a dragon that can steal turns; the winner faces the dragon in a final round where it blocks three-in-a-row attempts to prevent the $10,000 prize win.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717233000 +0000" stop="20250718000000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Bingo Blitz</title><desc>Contestants compete in a dynamic blend of trivia and bingo.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718000000 +0000" stop="20250718010000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>The Wall</title><desc>Two cousins vie for the prize.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718010000 +0000" stop="20250718020000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Press Your Luck</title><desc>Contestants from Sri Lanka, Oxnard, Calif., and Chicago, Ill.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718020000 +0000" stop="20250718023000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718023000 +0000" stop="20250718030000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718030000 +0000" stop="20250718033000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718033000 +0000" stop="20250718040000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718040000 +0000" stop="20250718043000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718043000 +0000" stop="20250718050000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Flip Side</title><desc>The hilarious new survey game show explores answers to questions from differing perspectives; host Jaleel White.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718050000 +0000" stop="20250718053000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Wheel of Fortune</title><desc>In a classic game-show version of &quot;Hangman,&quot; contestants solve word puzzles for cash and prizes.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718053000 +0000" stop="20250718060000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Switch</title><desc>Jeff Hephner challenges contestants who are ranked based on their answers to trivia questions for a chance at $10,000; every question counts, as each answer can propel them to the top or to the bottom, where they&apos;ll be in jeopardy of elimination.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718060000 +0000" stop="20250718063000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>People Puzzler</title><desc>Three contestants put their pop culture knowledge to the test to complete crosswords based on the iconic puzzles in People magazine.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718063000 +0000" stop="20250718070000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718070000 +0000" stop="20250718073000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718073000 +0000" stop="20250718080000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Stapleton Family vs. Fountain Family.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718080000 +0000" stop="20250718083000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Freedom to Leave the House!

Teams earn money for each word they guess correctly, and the team with the most money at the end of the game goes on to the bonus round, dubbed the Super Chain, for a chance to add an additional $5,000 to the total the team won during the main part of the game.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717220000 +0000" stop="20250717223000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717223000 +0000" stop="20250717230000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717230000 +0000" stop="20250717233000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Tic Tac Dough</title><desc>Two contestants compete to place three marks in a row on trivia board avoiding a dragon that can steal turns; the winner faces the dragon in a final round where it blocks three-in-a-row attempts to prevent the $10,000 prize win.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717233000 +0000" stop="20250718000000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Bingo Blitz</title><desc>Contestants compete in a dynamic blend of trivia and bingo.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718000000 +0000" stop="20250718010000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>The Wall</title><desc>Two cousins vie for the prize.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718010000 +0000" stop="20250718020000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Press Your Luck</title><desc>Contestants from Sri Lanka, Oxnard, Calif., and Chicago, Ill.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718020000 +0000" stop="20250718023000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718023000 +0000" stop="20250718030000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718030000 +0000" stop="20250718033000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718033000 +0000" stop="20250718040000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718040000 +0000" stop="20250718043000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718043000 +0000" stop="20250718050000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Flip Side</title><desc>The hilarious new survey game show explores answers to questions from differing perspectives; host Jaleel White.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718050000 +0000" stop="20250718053000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Wheel of Fortune</title><desc>In a classic game-show version of &quot;Hangman,&quot; contestants solve word puzzles for cash and prizes.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718053000 +0000" stop="20250718060000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Switch</title><desc>Jeff Hephner challenges contestants who are ranked based on their answers to trivia questions for a chance at $10,000; every question counts, as each answer can propel them to the top or to the bottom, where they&apos;ll be in jeopardy of elimination.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718060000 +0000" stop="20250718063000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>People Puzzler</title><desc>Three contestants put their pop culture knowledge to the test to complete crosswords based on the iconic puzzles in People magazine.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718063000 +0000" stop="20250718070000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718070000 +0000" stop="20250718073000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718073000 +0000" stop="20250718080000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Stapleton Family vs. Fountain Family.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718080000 +0000" stop="20250718083000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Freedom to Leave the House!
