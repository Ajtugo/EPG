The Bible portrays God&apos;s love as far surpassing human love, using parental imagery to highlight His unwavering compassion (Isa. 49:15, Hos. 11:1-9). Despite human unfaithfulness, God&apos;s love is enduring and visceral, as seen in Christ&apos;s compassion during His ministry. Divine jealousy is understood as righteous passion, seeking an exclusive relationship withHispeople.</desc></programme><programme start="20250121200000 +0000" stop="20250121203000 +0000" channel="hopechannel.us"><title>Bible Heroes Game Show</title><desc>Nathan and Garrison lead the contestants into the extraordinary story of Jesus Christ, from His humble birth in a manger to His ultimate sacrifice on the cross.</desc></programme><programme start="20250121203000 +0000" stop="20250121210000 +0000" channel="hopechannel.us"><title>The Torchlighters</title><desc>The story of The Bible smuggler who brought light into the dark kingdom of Korea.</desc></programme><programme start="20250121210000 +0000" stop="20250121213000 +0000" channel="hopechannel.us"><title>Into the Bible</title></programme><programme start="20250121213000 +0000" stop="20250121220000 +0000" channel="hopechannel.us"><title>King&apos;s Kids</title><desc>&quot;Looking Out for Others&quot;: Focusing on how God calls people to serve others; Looking at the story of Abram looking out for his nephew lot.</desc></programme><programme start="20250121220000 +0000" stop="20250121223000 +0000" channel="hopechannel.us"><title>Cliff!</title><desc>Author and speaker Cliff Goldstein melds basic truths, literature, and popular culture to answer some of life&apos;s most abstract questions.

If a player answers incorrectly three times, he is kicked out of the cab without any money. Help options include a Mobile Shout-Out (phone call) and Street Shout-Out (asking a stranger on the street). Once the player reaches his destination, he can leave the cab with his winnings, if any, or risk them on a more difficult question. A correct final answer doubles his winnings; an incorrect answer means he leaves the cab with no money at all.

The Bible portrays God&apos;s love as far surpassing human love, using parental imagery to highlight His unwavering compassion (Isa. 49:15, Hos. 11:1-9). Despite human unfaithfulness, God&apos;s love is enduring and visceral, as seen in Christ&apos;s compassion during His ministry. Divine jealousy is understood as righteous passion, seeking an exclusive relationship withHispeople.</desc></programme><programme start="20250121200000 +0000" stop="20250121203000 +0000" channel="hopechannel.us"><title>Bible Heroes Game Show</title><desc>Nathan and Garrison lead the contestants into the extraordinary story of Jesus Christ, from His humble birth in a manger to His ultimate sacrifice on the cross.</desc></programme><programme start="20250121203000 +0000" stop="20250121210000 +0000" channel="hopechannel.us"><title>The Torchlighters</title><desc>The story of The Bible smuggler who brought light into the dark kingdom of Korea.</desc></programme><programme start="20250121210000 +0000" stop="20250121213000 +0000" channel="hopechannel.us"><title>Into the Bible</title></programme><programme start="20250121213000 +0000" stop="20250121220000 +0000" channel="hopechannel.us"><title>King&apos;s Kids</title><desc>&quot;Looking Out for Others&quot;: Focusing on how God calls people to serve others; Looking at the story of Abram looking out for his nephew lot.</desc></programme><programme start="20250121220000 +0000" stop="20250121223000 +0000" channel="hopechannel.us"><title>Cliff!</title><desc>Author and speaker Cliff Goldstein melds basic truths, literature, and popular culture to answer some of life&apos;s most abstract questions.
