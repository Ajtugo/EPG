Bubba, Cody, and Booger must monitor their heifers around the clock and still find time to shop for gifts, decorate for Christmas, and enjoy time with their families. Booger helps Matthew pick out an extra-special gift to top Grandma’s Christmas tree. Cody looks to buy Carter the perfect cute new puppy. Kaley enlists the wives to help prepare for the Thompson’s annual holiday party.

A local rancher asks the guys to remove an ornery bull from his property, but this one is as bullheaded as they come—and takes longer than expected. Tired of scrapping for day wages, the cowboys decide to put their hard-earned experience to use: instead of working cattle for others, they’ll start brokering herds themselves. After sifting through his grandmother’s old photos, Booger reconnects with his past, then looks to the future by passing on “the cowboy way” to four-year-old Matthew. While Bubba confides in Kaley that the cowboys are reevaluating their business, Cody gets bad news about his upcoming rodeo, which is even worse news for his bank account.</desc></programme><programme start="20250529060000 +0000" stop="20250529062900 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Rifleman</title><desc>S4 E25 None So Blind Mark befriends Lafayette Blye, a blind banjo-playing man.

A simple wrangling job leads to the perfect cattle trading opportunity. The guys plot a course for Texas to capitalize on a buyer’s market. Cody forgets his saddle on a routine roundup, and the only thing sorer than his backside is his ego when Booger and Bubba don’t let him live down his mistake. After months of searching, Jaclyn and Booger finally find a piece of land perfect for settling down. But can they pull the trigger on the property before someone else swoops in? Bubba gets in hot water with Kaley when he tells Andrew, a long-term friend and ranch hand, that he can crash at their place—but without asking her first. Still licking his wounds from a double-cross, Cody weighs the pros and cons of holding his own rodeo. As their wives juggle life back home, the cowboys hit the road to broker their first big deal. They hope to find the crossbred cattle their buyer is looking for in the Lone Star State.</desc></programme><programme start="20250529170000 +0000" stop="20250529180000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Cowboy Way</title><desc>The cowboys are deep in the heart of Texas! In this episode of The Cowboy Way, the guys try to cash in on a cattle bounty roundup: hard cash for each cow they catch. But this money ain’t easy thanks to a sprawling 500-acre ranch covered in mesquite brush with razor-sharp thorns. Just when the cowboys think they’ve found a promising Texas cattle connection, Booger makes a big mistake that could jeopardize their first meeting with a hard-nosed rancher. Back in Alabama, Bubba and Kaley’s house guest is beginning to overstay his welcome. As they try to teach Andrew the Thompson house rules, he commits the biggest cowboy sin of all — messing with Bubba’s grill! Booger, Jaclyn, and Matthew care for a new-born calf. Misty has a special surprise for Cody.

A simple wrangling job leads to the perfect cattle trading opportunity. The guys plot a course for Texas to capitalize on a buyer’s market. Cody forgets his saddle on a routine roundup, and the only thing sorer than his backside is his ego when Booger and Bubba don’t let him live down his mistake. After months of searching, Jaclyn and Booger finally find a piece of land perfect for settling down. But can they pull the trigger on the property before someone else swoops in? Bubba gets in hot water with Kaley when he tells Andrew, a long-term friend and ranch hand, that he can crash at their place—but without asking her first. Still licking his wounds from a double-cross, Cody weighs the pros and cons of holding his own rodeo. As their wives juggle life back home, the cowboys hit the road to broker their first big deal. They hope to find the crossbred cattle their buyer is looking for in the Lone Star State.</desc></programme><programme start="20250530050000 +0000" stop="20250530060000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Cowboy Way</title><desc>The cowboys are deep in the heart of Texas! In this episode of The Cowboy Way, the guys try to cash in on a cattle bounty roundup: hard cash for each cow they catch. But this money ain’t easy thanks to a sprawling 500-acre ranch covered in mesquite brush with razor-sharp thorns. Just when the cowboys think they’ve found a promising Texas cattle connection, Booger makes a big mistake that could jeopardize their first meeting with a hard-nosed rancher. Back in Alabama, Bubba and Kaley’s house guest is beginning to overstay his welcome. As they try to teach Andrew the Thompson house rules, he commits the biggest cowboy sin of all — messing with Bubba’s grill! Booger, Jaclyn, and Matthew care for a new-born calf. Misty has a special surprise for Cody. An offer to travel back to Texas for another cattle drive doesn’t thrill the cowboys, but they begin to consider the networking potential and how it might make their cattle-trading dreams come true.</desc></programme><programme start="20250530060000 +0000" stop="20250530062900 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Rifleman</title><desc>S4 E27 Guilty Conscience As soon as aging Leota Carraway and her teenage son, Hab, arrive in North Fork, they see Marshal Micah Torrance, who she takes as her long-lost husband who abandoned her 16 years ago.

After briefly tending to business and family in Alabama, the guys head back to the Lone Star State to try and expand their network of contacts. Bubba, Cody, and Booger help their new friend Cash with a big Texas cattle drive in the hopes of both leading the herd to greener pastures and finding the big cattle deal they came west for. On the range they forge deeper bonds with their Texas counterparts, swapping cowboy stories around the campfire. But things take a turn for the worse when the herd overheats, and the creek they’re all counting on has run dry as a bone. Back home, Jaclyn and Matthew are learning to love life on the ranch. Houseguest Andrew’s disgusting habits have Kaley seeing red. And just as Misty gets back in the barrel-racing saddle, she starts to butt heads with her high-strung mare.</desc></programme><programme start="20250602170000 +0000" stop="20250602180000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Cowboy Way</title><desc>S5 E5 The Fall of Booger Bubba, Booger and Cody take an important step toward becoming big-time cattle brokers!

Just as the cowboys are about to leave Texas, a local rancher makes them an offer they can’t refuse. Will the guys gamble on a cattle deal, taking on a herd before they have a buyer lined up? Back home in Alabama, Kaley’s patience reaches a breaking point as houseguest Andrew tracks in mud and expects a free lunch. To top it off, he then asks if his whole family can crash there while he searches for a permanent residence. Misty finds some extra help with her troublesome barrel-racing horse. Booger and Matthew are on the hunt for the perfect one-year anniversary gift for Jaclyn.

Each link in the chain forms a compound word or phrase with the word before and/or after it. Teams earn money for each word they guess correctly, and the team with the most money at the end of the game goes on to the bonus round, dubbed the Super Chain, for a chance to add an additional $5,000 to the total the team won during the main part of the game.</desc></programme><programme start="20250530220000 +0000" stop="20250530223000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>Sisters Dana, India and Darla work together as they attempt to cross an interactive bridge by answering a series of general knowledge trivia questions, where the game board is beneath their feet.</desc></programme><programme start="20250530223000 +0000" stop="20250530230000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions;

In the third round, &quot;Final Jeopardy,&quot; the contestants can name their own jackpot - as long as it&apos;s within the amount of money they&apos;ve already earned. If a player finishes the second round with zero dollars, they are eliminated from &quot;Final Jeopardy.&quot; The first version of &quot;Jeopardy!,&quot; which aired from 1964 to 1975 on NBC, was hosted by Art Fleming.

Bubba, Cody, and Booger must monitor their heifers around the clock and still find time to shop for gifts, decorate for Christmas, and enjoy time with their families. Booger helps Matthew pick out an extra-special gift to top Grandma’s Christmas tree. Cody looks to buy Carter the perfect cute new puppy. Kaley enlists the wives to help prepare for the Thompson’s annual holiday party.

A local rancher asks the guys to remove an ornery bull from his property, but this one is as bullheaded as they come—and takes longer than expected. Tired of scrapping for day wages, the cowboys decide to put their hard-earned experience to use: instead of working cattle for others, they’ll start brokering herds themselves. After sifting through his grandmother’s old photos, Booger reconnects with his past, then looks to the future by passing on “the cowboy way” to four-year-old Matthew. While Bubba confides in Kaley that the cowboys are reevaluating their business, Cody gets bad news about his upcoming rodeo, which is even worse news for his bank account.</desc></programme><programme start="20250529060000 +0000" stop="20250529062900 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Rifleman</title><desc>S4 E25 None So Blind Mark befriends Lafayette Blye, a blind banjo-playing man.

Leaving Fort Mandan after their first winter on the frontier, the Corps of Discovery enters completely uncharted territory.
