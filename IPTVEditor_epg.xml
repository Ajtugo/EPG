But in the late 1800s, the nation&apos;s buffalo were nearly wiped out by ruthless hide hunters. Those majestic herds, which once numbered in the tens of millions, were down to less than 500 animals. This is the story of the handful of determined men and women who mobilized to save the ones that were left in a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction. Ranchers like Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight rescued orphaned buffalo calves and built small herds. Former buffalo hunters like Buffalo Bill helped build public sympathy. And politicians like Theodore Roosevelt helped pass laws to protect the remaining animals. The effort would be a generational one, with buffalo herds carefully tended, bred, and passed down to new stewards when their old protectors passed away. Thanks to their efforts, there are an estimated 500,000 buffalo thundering across America&apos;s grasslands once again.</desc></programme><programme start="20241209110000 +0000" stop="20241209130000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>County Line</title><desc>When his best friend, Sheriff Clint Thorne (Jeff Fahey, Texas Rising, Justified), is brutally gunned down, former neighboring county sheriff, Alden Rockwell (Tom Wopat, The Dukes Of Hazzard, Longmire) is left with many questions and no answers.

Cody finds the perfect herd to start a special cattle sale and shares his idea for the business with Bubba, but he is hesitant. Once Booger is back, the cowboys meet to discuss the future of their business, but they don’t all see eye-to-eye.

With Cody still fixated on the specialty cattle sale, Misty encourages him to do it on his own, without the help of Bubba and Booger. A new opportunity falls in Bubba’s lap to operate a ranch for a group of organic feed investors.

But in the late 1800s, the nation&apos;s buffalo were nearly wiped out by ruthless hide hunters. Those majestic herds, which once numbered in the tens of millions, were down to less than 500 animals. This is the story of the handful of determined men and women who mobilized to save the ones that were left in a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction. Ranchers like Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight rescued orphaned buffalo calves and built small herds. Former buffalo hunters like Buffalo Bill helped build public sympathy. And politicians like Theodore Roosevelt helped pass laws to protect the remaining animals. The effort would be a generational one, with buffalo herds carefully tended, bred, and passed down to new stewards when their old protectors passed away. Thanks to their efforts, there are an estimated 500,000 buffalo thundering across America&apos;s grasslands once again.</desc></programme><programme start="20241209110000 +0000" stop="20241209130000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>County Line</title><desc>When his best friend, Sheriff Clint Thorne (Jeff Fahey, Texas Rising, Justified), is brutally gunned down, former neighboring county sheriff, Alden Rockwell (Tom Wopat, The Dukes Of Hazzard, Longmire) is left with many questions and no answers.
