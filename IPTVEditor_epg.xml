Written&quot; has been a staple on American television since premiering in 1956. The weekly program, currently hosted by John Bradshaw, applies timeless truths to everyday life, with many episodes dealing with issues such as loneliness, fear, low self-esteem and spiritual principles. With its straightforward, uplifting presentations, the program aims to inspire and encourage people of all faiths and creeds.

Each link in the chain forms a compound word or phrase with the word before and/or after it.

If a player answers incorrectly three times, he is kicked out of the cab without any money. Help options include a Mobile Shout-Out (phone call) and Street Shout-Out (asking a stranger on the street). Once the player reaches his destination, he can leave the cab with his winnings, if any, or risk them on a more difficult question. A correct final answer doubles his winnings; an incorrect answer means he leaves the cab with no money at all.

That sets into motion a chaotic chain of events and leads IDF into a manhunt to locate and kill the squad&apos;s target.</desc></programme><programme start="20250511210000 +0000" stop="20250511223000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Prisoners of War</title><desc>Two soldiers try to readjust to normal life after 17 years in captivity.</desc></programme><programme start="20250511223000 +0000" stop="20250511230000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Inside Fauda</title></programme><programme start="20250511230000 +0000" stop="20250511233000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>ILTV News</title><desc>Daily news from the State of Israel.</desc></programme><programme start="20250511233000 +0000" stop="20250512000000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Israel Weekly Review</title></programme><programme start="20250512000000 +0000" stop="20250512003000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Cruising Israel</title><desc>Travel to well-known sites and hidden gems within the State of Israel.</desc></programme><programme start="20250512003000 +0000" stop="20250512010000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Explore Israel</title><desc>Exploring different aspects of Israel: history, landmarks, tourism, lifestyle, celebrities, politics and more.</desc></programme><programme start="20250512010000 +0000" stop="20250512020000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Air, Land and Sea</title><desc>Uncovering the triumphs and tribulations of the Jewish people in locales from across the world.</desc></programme><programme start="20250512020000 +0000" stop="20250512030000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Unpacked: The History of Israel Explained</title><desc>Unpacking the complexities of Judaism and Israel into bite-sized morsels.</desc></programme><programme start="20250512030000 +0000" stop="20250512033000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Cruising Israel</title><desc>Travel to well-known sites and hidden gems within the State of Israel.</desc></programme><programme start="20250512033000 +0000" stop="20250512040000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Explore Israel</title><desc>Exploring different aspects of Israel: history, landmarks, tourism, lifestyle, celebrities, politics and more.</desc></programme><programme start="20250512040000 +0000" stop="20250512050000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Air, Land and Sea</title><desc>Uncovering the triumphs and tribulations of the Jewish people in locales from across the world.</desc></programme><programme start="20250512050000 +0000" stop="20250512060000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Unpacked: The History of Israel Explained</title><desc>Unpacking the complexities of Judaism and Israel into bite-sized morsels.</desc></programme><programme start="20250512060000 +0000" stop="20250512063000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>ILTV News</title><desc>Daily news from the State of Israel.</desc></programme><programme start="20250512063000 +0000" stop="20250512070000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Vision of the Bible</title><desc>Emilio Roso takes a journey through the Book of Matthew, exploring the sights and sounds of the Holy Land; the Story of Jesus Christ from his birth to his ministry, crucifixion and resurrection.</desc></programme><programme start="20250512070000 +0000" stop="20250512073000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>You Bet Your Life</title><desc>Groucho Marx hosts a question-and-answer game show.</desc></programme><programme start="20250512073000 +0000" stop="20250512080000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>The Jack Benny Program</title><desc>The comedian provides laughs with a series of guest stars.</desc></programme><programme start="20250512080000 +0000" stop="20250512090000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Bonanza</title><desc>Ben Cartwright is the patriarch of an all-male Nevada ranching family.
