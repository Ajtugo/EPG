The premise is simple: two teams try to complete chains of seven words. The first and last word in each chain are revealed, and the contestants must guess the missing words, with one letter being revealed each turn. Each link in the chain forms a compound word or phrase with the word before and/or after it. Teams earn money for each word they guess correctly, and the team with the most money at the end of the game goes on to the bonus round, dubbed the Super Chain, for a chance to add an additional $5,000 to the total the team won during the main part of the game.</desc></programme><programme start="20250922220000 +0000" stop="20250922223000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250922223000 +0000" stop="20250922230000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250922230000 +0000" stop="20250922233000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Tic Tac Dough</title><desc>Two contestants compete to place three marks in a row on trivia board avoiding a dragon that can steal turns; the winner faces the dragon in a final round where it blocks three-in-a-row attempts to prevent the $10,000 prize win.</desc></programme><programme start="20250922233000 +0000" stop="20250923000000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Bingo Blitz</title><desc>Contestants compete in a dynamic blend of trivia and bingo.</desc></programme><programme start="20250923000000 +0000" stop="20250923010000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>The Wall</title><desc>Mother-daughter duo Kavi and Radhika, representing Green Brook, N.J., take on the ups and downs of contending on the wall.</desc></programme><programme start="20250923010000 +0000" stop="20250923020000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Press Your Luck</title><desc>Contestants from San Francisco, Chicago and Cleveland compete.</desc></programme><programme start="20250923020000 +0000" stop="20250923023000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey assumes the hosting duties for this daytime game show in which five members of one family are pitted against five members of another family.
