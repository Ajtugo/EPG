Now down to ten cowboys, the competition continues with an all-new immunity challenge that focuses on a whole different aspect of cowboyin&apos; — business acumen. The contestants must prove they know the cattle market by estimating the value of various livestock at auction. Trace asks the contestants to continue to train the colts from the last elimination challenge, but they struggle to develop a plan that will work for everyone. The elimination challenge tests the contestants&apos; team strategy, roping, and speed. Each team has forty-five minutes to collect fifteen gold ear tags from mixed herds in two different pastures. Frustrations build when the green team has trouble with the pens, and a cow escapes during the blue team&apos;s run. As the competition intensifies, one cowboy tries to get rid of his biggest competition. Unimpressed by how the teams handled the challenge, Trace shakes things up by sending two cowboys home.</desc></programme><programme start="20250514230000 +0000" stop="20250514235700 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Young Riders</title><desc>S3 E9 Spirits Rachel falls for a military division agent who has a drinking problem.

The contestants must prove they know the cattle market by estimating the value of various livestock at auction. Trace asks the contestants to continue to train the colts from the last elimination challenge, but they struggle to develop a plan that will work for everyone. The elimination challenge tests the contestants&apos; team strategy, roping, and speed. Each team has forty-five minutes to collect fifteen gold ear tags from mixed herds in two different pastures. Frustrations build when the green team has trouble with the pens, and a cow escapes during the blue team&apos;s run. As the competition intensifies, one cowboy tries to get rid of his biggest competition. Unimpressed by how the teams handled the challenge, Trace shakes things up by sending two cowboys home.</desc></programme><programme start="20250515110000 +0000" stop="20250515120000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Young Riders</title><desc>S3 E9 Spirits Rachel falls for a military division agent who has a drinking problem.

He gets roped back into active duty, though, upon learning that an enemy who Doron thought his unit had killed is still alive and plans on attending his brother&apos;s wedding. Doron rejoins the IDF team with the intention of going under cover at the wedding, but the plan goes awry when the team&apos;s cover is blown. That sets into motion a chaotic chain of events and leads IDF into a manhunt to locate and kill the squad&apos;s target.</desc></programme><programme start="20250518210000 +0000" stop="20250518223000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Prisoners of War</title><desc>Two soldiers try to readjust to normal life after 17 years in captivity.</desc></programme><programme start="20250518223000 +0000" stop="20250518230000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Inside Fauda</title></programme><programme start="20250518230000 +0000" stop="20250518233000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>ILTV News</title><desc>Daily news from the State of Israel.</desc></programme><programme start="20250518233000 +0000" stop="20250519000000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Israel Weekly Review</title></programme><programme start="20250519000000 +0000" stop="20250519003000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Cruising Israel</title><desc>Travel to well-known sites and hidden gems within the State of Israel.</desc></programme><programme start="20250519003000 +0000" stop="20250519010000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Explore Israel</title><desc>Exploring different aspects of Israel: history, landmarks, tourism, lifestyle, celebrities, politics and more.</desc></programme><programme start="20250519010000 +0000" stop="20250519020000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Air, Land and Sea</title><desc>Uncovering the triumphs and tribulations of the Jewish people in locales from across the world.</desc></programme><programme start="20250519020000 +0000" stop="20250519030000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Unpacked: The History of Israel Explained</title><desc>Unpacking the complexities of Judaism and Israel into bite-sized morsels.</desc></programme><programme start="20250519030000 +0000" stop="20250519033000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Cruising Israel</title><desc>Travel to well-known sites and hidden gems within the State of Israel.</desc></programme><programme start="20250519033000 +0000" stop="20250519040000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Explore Israel</title><desc>Exploring different aspects of Israel: history, landmarks, tourism, lifestyle, celebrities, politics and more.</desc></programme><programme start="20250519040000 +0000" stop="20250519050000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Air, Land and Sea</title><desc>Uncovering the triumphs and tribulations of the Jewish people in locales from across the world.</desc></programme><programme start="20250519050000 +0000" stop="20250519060000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Unpacked: The History of Israel Explained</title><desc>Unpacking the complexities of Judaism and Israel into bite-sized morsels.</desc></programme><programme start="20250519060000 +0000" stop="20250519063000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>ILTV News</title><desc>Daily news from the State of Israel.</desc></programme><programme start="20250519063000 +0000" stop="20250519070000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Vision of the Bible</title><desc>Emilio Roso takes a journey through the Book of Matthew, exploring the sights and sounds of the Holy Land; the Story of Jesus Christ from his birth to his ministry, crucifixion and resurrection.</desc></programme><programme start="20250519070000 +0000" stop="20250519073000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>You Bet Your Life</title><desc>Groucho Marx hosts a question-and-answer game show.</desc></programme><programme start="20250519073000 +0000" stop="20250519080000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>The Jack Benny Program</title><desc>The comedian provides laughs with a series of guest stars.</desc></programme><programme start="20250519080000 +0000" stop="20250519090000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Bonanza</title><desc>Ben Cartwright is the patriarch of an all-male Nevada ranching family.

Two teammates, who have had it out for each other from the start, decide to set their differences aside for the team&apos;s greater good, and to their surprise, they work well together. In the elimination challenge, each team has to sort a herd of cattle by their ear tag colors and drive them into three separate corrals.

When their equipment fails, Cody and Misty unload new cow pens the old-fashioned way.
