Charlie Russell is an aimless cowhand who loves the freedom of the cowboy way of life, and he is a self-taught artist who enjoys capturing the scenes of his rugged work on the range. Too embarrassed to ask people to pay for his paintings, he gives most of them away to friends or trades them for drinks at the saloon. But that changes quickly after he falls in love. Charlie’s new bride Nancy gives him the encouragement he needs to stop cowboying in order to focus on his artwork. Under her watchful eye, he sobers up, stops cowboying, and improves his mastery of painting. Nancy is so proud of Charlie’s talent that she doesn’t hesitate to ask top dollar for his paintings. Years later, when legendary gunfighter-turned-newspaperman Bat Masterson tries to do a piece on Charlie, he quickly realizes that he must first deal with the woman behind the famous cowboy artist Charles M. Russell.</desc></programme><programme start="20241222212800 +0000" stop="20241222220000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Wild West Chronicles</title><desc>S2 E4 The Legend of Nat Love

Charlie Russell is an aimless cowhand who loves the freedom of the cowboy way of life, and he is a self-taught artist who enjoys capturing the scenes of his rugged work on the range. Too embarrassed to ask people to pay for his paintings, he gives most of them away to friends or trades them for drinks at the saloon. But that changes quickly after he falls in love. Charlie’s new bride Nancy gives him the encouragement he needs to stop cowboying in order to focus on his artwork. Under her watchful eye, he sobers up, stops cowboying, and improves his mastery of painting. Nancy is so proud of Charlie’s talent that she doesn’t hesitate to ask top dollar for his paintings. Years later, when legendary gunfighter-turned-newspaperman Bat Masterson tries to do a piece on Charlie, he quickly realizes that he must first deal with the woman behind the famous cowboy artist Charles M.
