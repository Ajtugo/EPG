The weekly program, currently hosted by John Bradshaw, applies timeless truths to everyday life, with many episodes dealing with issues such as loneliness, fear, low self-esteem and spiritual principles. With its straightforward, uplifting presentations, the program aims to inspire and encourage people of all faiths and creeds. Founded by George Vandeman, &quot;It Is Written&quot; was the first religious telecast to air in color.</desc></programme><programme start="20250210180000 +0000" stop="20250210183000 +0000"
