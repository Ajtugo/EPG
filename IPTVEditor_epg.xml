Set during and after the Civil War, &quot;Bonanza&quot; is the story of life on the family&apos;s thousand-acre spread, known as the Ponderosa, near Virginia City. Ben has his three sons, each with a different (and deceased) mother. Serious eldest son Adam hopes to follow in his father&apos;s footsteps; middle son Hoss is a gentle giant -- physically strong, but sometimes naive; and youngest son Little Joe is the most impetuous and romantic of the offspring.</desc></programme><programme start="20250930090000 +0000" stop="20250930093000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Annie Oakley</title><desc>The suspenseful tales of the Old West&apos;s famous sharp shooter.</desc></programme><programme start="20250930093000 +0000" stop="20250930100000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Stories of the Century</title><desc>Railroad detective Matt Clark solves mysteries with his assistant.</desc></programme><programme start="20250930100000 +0000" stop="20250930103000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Bodies in Motion With Gilad</title><desc>Israeli exercise guru Gilad Janklowicz and his team exercise on the beaches of Hawaii.</desc></programme><programme start="20250930103000 +0000" stop="20250930110000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Total Body Sculpt With Gilad</title><desc>Gilad Janklowicz combines several types of exercise into one workout routine, including strength and circuit training, cardio, kickboxing, and martial arts.

Bubba, Cody, and Booger help their new friend Cash with a big Texas cattle drive in the hopes of both leading the herd to greener pastures and finding the big cattle deal they came west for. On the range they forge deeper bonds with their Texas counterparts, swapping cowboy stories around the campfire. But things take a turn for the worse when the herd overheats, and the creek they&apos;re all counting on has run dry as a bone. Back home, Jaclyn and Matthew are learning to love life on the ranch.

Back home in Alabama, Kaley&apos;s patience reaches a breaking point as houseguest Andrew tracks in mud and expects a free lunch. To top it off, he then asks if his whole family can crash there while he searches for a permanent residence. Misty finds some extra help with her troublesome barrel-racing horse.

Looking to offload their new herd, the guys head down to the local stockyard to hone their bartering skills. Cody bounces a crazy rodeo idea off the boys - then uses them guinea pigs. Bubba plans a short getaway with Kaley, but there&apos;s a big catch: Booger&apos;s been tapped as the babysitter, with Jaclyn lending a helping hand. Kaley wonders if Booger is up to the challenge. His first attempts to feed and dress little Andie suggest he most certainly is not! While Bubba and Kaley aren&apos;t sure they&apos;ll return home to find everything in one piece, they do get some great news from houseguest Andrew. Cody is desperate to find the final missing piece for his rodeo: an announcer.

Andrew&apos;s bags are finally packed and he&apos;s clearing out. Though Bubba and Kaley hate to see him go, they also love watching him leave! Since the cowboys have been buying cattle left and right, word&apos;s gotten out about the Faith Cattle Company&apos;s trading business. This leads to Booger and Bubba boarding a private jet to meet some Texas investors looking to place a make-or-break order. As the guys hustle to gather all the cattle in time, they find themselves bidding against an old friend at the sale barn. Rodeo night brings all the families together - and even Andrew makes a surprise appearance. As the season draws to a close, the cowboys have everything on the line: their own money, as well as their reputations.</desc></programme><programme start="20250930180000 +0000" stop="20250930183000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Rifleman</title><desc>S1 E33 The Money Gun Lucas has a disdain for Oat Jackford since years ago he burned down his ranch to get him off property he wanted.
