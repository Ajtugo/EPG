At this point, one mistake can cost any of them the competition. A series of challenges test the remaining contestants on their mastery of essential cowboy skills: horsemanship, roping, and cattle handling. One of the top competitors delivers less-than-perfect results for the first time and misses the mark during a steer-roping challenge. When tending to the cattle, two of the contestants&apos; lack of experience comes to light, putting the health of the herd at risk. One of the competitors uses his experience as a cow boss and takes control of the group challenge. The other cowboys question his direction, unsure if his tactics will be successful. Trace makes a tough decision and sends someone packing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250710110000 +0000" stop="20250710120000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Young Riders</title><desc>S1 E19 Man Behind the Badge Van Dorn, a corrupt businessman and the man responsible for the murder of Marshal Sam Cain&apos;s wife, comes to Sweetwater.

The first and last word in each chain are revealed, and the contestants must guess the missing words, with one letter being revealed each turn. Each link in the chain forms a compound word or phrase with the word before and/or after it. Teams earn money for each word they guess correctly, and the team with the most money at the end of the game goes on to the bonus round, dubbed the Super Chain, for a chance to add an additional $5,000 to the total the team won during the main part of the game.</desc></programme><programme start="20250710220000 +0000" stop="20250710223000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250710223000 +0000" stop="20250710230000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250710230000 +0000" stop="20250710233000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Tic Tac Dough</title><desc>Two contestants compete to place three marks in a row on trivia board avoiding a dragon that can steal turns; the winner faces the dragon in a final round where it blocks three-in-a-row attempts to prevent the $10,000 prize win.</desc></programme><programme start="20250710233000 +0000" stop="20250711000000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Bingo Blitz</title><desc>Contestants compete in a dynamic blend of trivia and bingo.</desc></programme><programme start="20250711000000 +0000" stop="20250711010000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>The Wall</title><desc>Everyday people battle a variety of trivia questions and a 40-foot wall for a chance to win millions of dollars.

The premise is simple: two teams try to complete chains of seven words. The first and last word in each chain are revealed, and the contestants must guess the missing words, with one letter being revealed each turn. Each link in the chain forms a compound word or phrase with the word before and/or after it. Teams earn money for each word they guess correctly, and the team with the most money at the end of the game goes on to the bonus round, dubbed the Super Chain, for a chance to add an additional $5,000 to the total the team won during the main part of the game.</desc></programme><programme start="20250711220000 +0000" stop="20250711223000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250711223000 +0000" stop="20250711230000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250711230000 +0000" stop="20250711233000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Tic Tac Dough</title><desc>Two contestants compete to place three marks in a row on trivia board avoiding a dragon that can steal turns; the winner faces the dragon in a final round where it blocks three-in-a-row attempts to prevent the $10,000 prize win.</desc></programme><programme start="20250711233000 +0000" stop="20250712000000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Bingo Blitz</title><desc>Contestants compete in a dynamic blend of trivia and bingo.</desc></programme><programme start="20250712000000 +0000" stop="20250712010000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>The Wall</title><desc>Everyday people battle a variety of trivia questions and a 40-foot wall for a chance to win millions of dollars.
