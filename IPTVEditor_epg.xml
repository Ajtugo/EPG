Bat Masterson, former gunfighter and sheriff, is now working as a newspaperman. He heads west again to uncover the story behind one of the country’s greatest train robberies. Although Butch and Sundance are long gone, Masterson tracks down Sundance’s former girlfriend, Etta Place, to draw out more details. To pull off the audacious robbery, they used official Union Pacific lanterns to signal the train and fool the engineer into believing a bridge was out. As Etta reluctantly relives the events of the robbery and its aftermath, it’s obvious that she is still smitten by Sundance after all of these years.</desc></programme><programme start="20250228220000 +0000" stop="20250228230000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Into The Wild Frontier</title><desc>S2 E7 Jim Clyman: Frontier Survivor
