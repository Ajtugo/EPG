The cowboys have two shots at making it to the final three with a two-part elimination challenge. In Part One, the first cowboy to rope, drive and load two steers and their horse in a trailer wins.

But just when the finish line is in view, Trace throws a curveball into the competition that catches the cowboys off guard.

On this episode of The Cowboy Way, the cowboys visit the Montgomery Stockyard to research cattle prices and Booger gets bitten by the auctioneering bug. Will his auctioneering classes pay off? Back at the ranch, the guys catch heat from a neighbor when their herd escapes into his field, and a rebellious heifer takes them on one heck of a ride. Misty’s brother-in-law, Chip, stops by and gives Cody an earful that his feeding pasture has turned to dirt. And when the cattle stock market takes a nosedive, the cowboys’ million-dollar business partner calls the gang into his office for a tough talk.</desc></programme><programme start="20250523060000 +0000" stop="20250523063000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Rifleman</title><desc>S3 E31 Stopover A brutal snowstorm makes the roads impassable and forces a stagecoach to stop at the McCain Ranch.

This time around, there’s no immunity challenge, and teams are a thing of the past. Every cowboy stands on their own, and one wrong move could cost them the competition. The cowboys have two shots at making it to the final three with a two-part elimination challenge. In Part One, the first cowboy to rope, drive and load two steers and their horse in a trailer wins. Two cowboys are neck and neck the entire round, but only one comes up on top. Part two’s obstacle course tests the contestants’ control and handling of the unruly colts they’ve been training since early on in the competition. But just when the finish line is in view, Trace throws a curveball into the competition that catches the cowboys off guard. While some thrive under the pressure, ultimately, the cowboy that can’t adapt in the moment goes home.</desc></programme><programme start="20250523110000 +0000" stop="20250523120000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Young Riders</title><desc>S3 E14 Shadowmen A Pinkerton agent comes to Rock Creek in search of a bank robber.

Russell: The Cowboy Artist Charlie Russell is an aimless cowhand who loves the freedom of the cowboy way of life, and he is a self-taught artist who enjoys capturing the scenes of his rugged work on the range. Too embarrassed to ask people to pay for his paintings, he gives most of them away to friends or trades them for drinks at the saloon. But that changes quickly after he falls in love. Charlie’s new bride Nancy gives him the encouragement he needs to stop cowboying in order to focus on his artwork. Under her watchful eye, he sobers up, stops cowboying, and improves his mastery of painting. Nancy is so proud of Charlie’s talent that she doesn’t hesitate to ask top dollar for his paintings. Years later, when legendary gunfighter-turned-newspaperman Bat Masterson tries to do a piece on Charlie, he quickly realizes that he must first deal with the woman behind the famous cowboy artist Charles M. Russell.</desc></programme><programme start="20250525100000 +0000" stop="20250525110000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Cheyenne</title><desc>S5 E4 Two Trails to Santa Fe Cheyenne helps an Apache woman escape torture from her tribe.

But in the late 1800s, the nation&apos;s buffalo were nearly wiped out by ruthless hide hunters. Those majestic herds, which once numbered in the tens of millions, were down to less than 500 animals. This is the story of the handful of determined men and women who mobilized to save the ones that were left in a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction. Ranchers like Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight rescued orphaned buffalo calves and built small herds. Former buffalo hunters like Buffalo Bill helped build public sympathy. And politicians like Theodore Roosevelt helped pass laws to protect the remaining animals. The effort would be a generational one, with buffalo herds carefully tended, bred, and passed down to new stewards when their old protectors passed away. Thanks to their efforts, there are an estimated 500,000 buffalo thundering across America&apos;s grasslands once again.</desc></programme><programme start="20250525220000 +0000" stop="20250525234700 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Legal Action</title><desc>Big-city lawyer Casey McKay, (Eric Close - Nashville, Without a Trace) a winner with a long hot streak, didn&apos;t expect the mysterious text from his ex-wife, Pru, (Tanya Clarke - A Beautiful Mind, Guiding Light) about her brother, Jay.

The cowboys have two shots at making it to the final three with a two-part elimination challenge. In Part One, the first cowboy to rope, drive and load two steers and their horse in a trailer wins. Two cowboys are neck and neck the entire round, but only one comes up on top.

But in the late 1800s, the nation&apos;s buffalo were nearly wiped out by ruthless hide hunters. Those majestic herds, which once numbered in the tens of millions, were down to less than 500 animals. This is the story of the handful of determined men and women who mobilized to save the ones that were left in a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction. Ranchers like Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight rescued orphaned buffalo calves and built small herds. Former buffalo hunters like Buffalo Bill helped build public sympathy. And politicians like Theodore Roosevelt helped pass laws to protect the remaining animals. The effort would be a generational one, with buffalo herds carefully tended, bred, and passed down to new stewards when their old protectors passed away. Thanks to their efforts, there are an estimated 500,000 buffalo thundering across America&apos;s grasslands once again.</desc></programme><programme start="20250525220000 +0000" stop="20250525234700 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Legal Action</title><desc>Big-city lawyer Casey McKay, (Eric Close - Nashville, Without a Trace) a winner with a long hot streak, didn&apos;t expect the mysterious text from his ex-wife, Pru, (Tanya Clarke - A Beautiful Mind, Guiding Light) about her brother, Jay.
