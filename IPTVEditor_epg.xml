Russell: The Cowboy Artist
Charlie Russell is an aimless cowhand who loves the freedom of the cowboy way of life, and he is a self-taught artist who enjoys capturing the scenes of his rugged work on the range. Too embarrassed to ask people to pay for his paintings, he gives most of them away to friends or trades them for drinks at the saloon. But that changes quickly after he falls in love. Charlie’s new bride Nancy gives him the encouragement he needs to stop cowboying in order to focus on his artwork. Under her watchful eye, he sobers up, stops cowboying, and improves his mastery of painting. Nancy is so proud of Charlie’s talent that she doesn’t hesitate to ask top dollar for his paintings. Years later, when legendary gunfighter-turned-newspaperman Bat Masterson tries to do a piece on Charlie, he quickly realizes that he must first deal with the woman behind the famous cowboy artist Charles M. Russell.</desc></programme><programme start="20250129100000 +0000" stop="20250129110000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Into The Wild Frontier</title><desc>S1 E1 John Colter: King of the Mountain Men

When former slave Jim Beckwourth heads west to seek work as a trapper, he begins what will become one of the most eventful, heroic lives of all the mountain men. As a joke, one of Beckwourth&apos;s fellow trappers tells a group of Crow warriors that Beckwourth is a long-lost member of their tribe, and the adventure begins. Adopted by the Crow, Beckwourth joins them in a series of ferocious battles with other tribes, becomes a war chief, and falls in love with a fierce female warrior named Pine Leaf.

As a fur trapper, hunter, scout, and explorer, Kit Carson is an irresistible subject for reporters and novelists, and his incredible adventures make him a mythic figure in his own lifetime. Yet fame is the last thing on Carson&apos;s mind in 1849. All he wants to do is settle down to a quiet life with his wife on the family ranch, but once again fate comes calling. When settler Ann White is captured by an Apache raiding party, the Army seeks out Carson to help track the warriors and rescue Mrs. White, whose husband was killed in the raid. Although known to be the best tracker in the history of the Western Frontier, Carson admits this is the most difficult trail he has ever followed. He leads the military on a desperate chase, tracking the Apache through 200 miles of treacherous western wilderness. When they finally catch up with the Apache, the aftermath leaves Carson haunted for the rest of his days.</desc></programme><programme start="20250128020000 +0000" stop="20250128030000 +0000" channel="oanplus.us"><title>Tipping Point With Kara McKinney</title><desc>Tipping Point.</desc></programme><programme start="20250128030000 +0000" stop="20250128040000 +0000" channel="oanplus.us"><title>Fine Point With Chanel Rion</title><desc>Chanel Rion leads bold and uncensored discourse on Big Tech, Big Media, and Big Government.

After her father’s death, nine-year-old Annie Oakley first picks up a rifle and begins shooting small game in order to feed her siblings and support her widowed mother. By her teenage years, Annie is so good at hunting that she begins supplying meat to a local grocery store, earning enough money to pay off her mother’s mortgage. When famed sharpshooter Frank Butler comes to town for an exhibition, Annie accepts his challenge to participate in a shooting match. Not only does she win the match, but she wins Butler’s heart as well. They are soon married, but they struggle to make it as a team on stage. A better shooter, Annie must become the main attraction for them to succeed. Years later, legendary gunfighter-turned-newspaperman Bat Masterson, tracks down Annie’s husband to learn more about the rise of this shooting star.</desc></programme><programme start="20250129092800 +0000" stop="20250129100000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Wild West Chronicles</title><desc>S1 E15 Charles M. Russell: The Cowboy Artist
Charlie Russell is an aimless cowhand who loves the freedom of the cowboy way of life, and he is a self-taught artist who enjoys capturing the scenes of his rugged work on the range. Too embarrassed to ask people to pay for his paintings, he gives most of them away to friends or trades them for drinks at the saloon. But that changes quickly after he falls in love. Charlie’s new bride Nancy gives him the encouragement he needs to stop cowboying in order to focus on his artwork. Under her watchful eye, he sobers up, stops cowboying, and improves his mastery of painting. Nancy is so proud of Charlie’s talent that she doesn’t hesitate to ask top dollar for his paintings. Years later, when legendary gunfighter-turned-newspaperman Bat Masterson tries to do a piece on Charlie, he quickly realizes that he must first deal with the woman behind the famous cowboy artist Charles M. Russell.</desc></programme><programme start="20250129100000 +0000" stop="20250129110000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Into The Wild Frontier</title><desc>S1 E1 John Colter: King of the Mountain Men
