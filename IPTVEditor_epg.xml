But in the late 1800s, the nation&apos;s buffalo were nearly wiped out by ruthless hide hunters. Those majestic herds, which once numbered in the tens of millions, were down to less than 500 animals. This is the story of the handful of determined men and women who mobilized to save the ones that were left in a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction. Ranchers like Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight rescued orphaned buffalo calves and built small herds. Former buffalo hunters like Buffalo Bill helped build public sympathy. And politicians like Theodore Roosevelt helped pass laws to protect the remaining animals. The effort would be a generational one, with buffalo herds carefully tended, bred, and passed down to new stewards when their old protectors passed away. Thanks to their efforts, there are an estimated 500,000 buffalo thundering across America&apos;s grasslands once again.</desc></programme><programme start="20250627200000 +0000" stop="20250627202900 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Wild West Chronicles</title><desc>S3 E10 The Discoveries of George McJunkin After a devastating storm, ranch foreman George McJunkin finds ancient bison fossils and flint points unearthed in a riverbank, and he sets out to find someone in the scientific community who will acknowledge the importance of his discovery.</desc></programme><programme start="20250627202900 +0000" stop="20250627210000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Wild West Chronicles</title><desc>S3 E7 Calamity Jane Saves the Day Throughout Deadwood, Calamity Jane is known as a hot-tempered drunk.

He wins the first skirmish, but the cowboys return with reinforcements and the stage is set for the biggest and longest gunfight in Old West history. Baca seeks shelter in a small adobe house and makes his stand against a small army of men who shoot up the house with thousands of rounds of ammunition over the course of 33 hours. Years later, legendary gunfighter-turned-newspaperman Bat Masterson gets the real story of what comes to be known as the Frisco Shootout from the former sheriff who deputized Baca just prior to the legendary gun battle.</desc></programme><programme start="20250628060000 +0000" stop="20250628063000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Rifleman</title><desc>S3 E9 Dead Cold Cash Sara Caruthers, the deceased widow of a bandit Lucas shot when he was a deputy marshal, has an unusal will to get revenge against McCain.

But in the late 1800s, the nation&apos;s buffalo were nearly wiped out by ruthless hide hunters. Those majestic herds, which once numbered in the tens of millions, were down to less than 500 animals. This is the story of the handful of determined men and women who mobilized to save the ones that were left in a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction. Ranchers like Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight rescued orphaned buffalo calves and built small herds. Former buffalo hunters like Buffalo Bill helped build public sympathy. And politicians like Theodore Roosevelt helped pass laws to protect the remaining animals. The effort would be a generational one, with buffalo herds carefully tended, bred, and passed down to new stewards when their old protectors passed away. Thanks to their efforts, there are an estimated 500,000 buffalo thundering across America&apos;s grasslands once again.</desc></programme><programme start="20250628080000 +0000" stop="20250628082900 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Wild West Chronicles</title><desc>S3 E10 The Discoveries of George McJunkin After a devastating storm, ranch foreman George McJunkin finds ancient bison fossils and flint points unearthed in a riverbank, and he sets out to find someone in the scientific community who will acknowledge the importance of his discovery.</desc></programme><programme start="20250628082900 +0000" stop="20250628090000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Wild West Chronicles</title><desc>S3 E7 Calamity Jane Saves the Day Throughout Deadwood, Calamity Jane is known as a hot-tempered drunk.

Serious eldest son Adam hopes to follow in his father&apos;s footsteps; middle son Hoss is a gentle giant -- physically strong, but sometimes naive; and youngest son Little Joe is the most impetuous and romantic of the offspring.</desc></programme><programme start="20250630090000 +0000" stop="20250630093000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Annie Oakley</title><desc>The suspenseful tales of the Old West&apos;s famous sharp shooter.</desc></programme><programme start="20250630093000 +0000" stop="20250630100000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Stories of the Century</title><desc>Railroad detective Matt Clark solves mysteries with his assistant.</desc></programme><programme start="20250630100000 +0000" stop="20250630103000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Bodies in Motion With Gilad</title><desc>Israeli exercise guru Gilad Janklowicz and his team exercise on the beaches of Hawaii.</desc></programme><programme start="20250630103000 +0000" stop="20250630110000 +0000" channel="jewishlifetv.us"><title>Total Body Sculpt With Gilad</title><desc>Gilad Janklowicz combines several types of exercise into one workout routine, including strength and circuit training, cardio, kickboxing, and martial arts.

He wins the first skirmish, but the cowboys return with reinforcements and the stage is set for the biggest and longest gunfight in Old West history. Baca seeks shelter in a small adobe house and makes his stand against a small army of men who shoot up the house with thousands of rounds of ammunition over the course of 33 hours.

But in the late 1800s, the nation&apos;s buffalo were nearly wiped out by ruthless hide hunters. Those majestic herds, which once numbered in the tens of millions, were down to less than 500 animals. This is the story of the handful of determined men and women who mobilized to save the ones that were left in a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction. Ranchers like Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight rescued orphaned buffalo calves and built small herds. Former buffalo hunters like Buffalo Bill helped build public sympathy. And politicians like Theodore Roosevelt helped pass laws to protect the remaining animals. The effort would be a generational one, with buffalo herds carefully tended, bred, and passed down to new stewards when their old protectors passed away. Thanks to their efforts, there are an estimated 500,000 buffalo thundering across America&apos;s grasslands once again.</desc></programme><programme start="20250627200000 +0000" stop="20250627202900 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Wild West Chronicles</title><desc>S3 E10 The Discoveries of George McJunkin After a devastating storm, ranch foreman George McJunkin finds ancient bison fossils and flint points unearthed in a riverbank, and he sets out to find someone in the scientific community who will acknowledge the importance of his discovery.</desc></programme><programme start="20250627202900 +0000" stop="20250627210000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Wild West Chronicles</title><desc>S3 E7 Calamity Jane Saves the Day Throughout Deadwood, Calamity Jane is known as a hot-tempered drunk.
