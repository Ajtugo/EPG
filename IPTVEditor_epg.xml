A local rancher asks the guys to remove an ornery bull from his property, but this one is as bullheaded as they come - and takes longer than expected. Tired of scrapping for day wages, the cowboys decide to put their hard-earned experience to use: instead of working cattle for others, they&apos;ll start brokering herds themselves. After sifting through his grandmother&apos;s old photos, Booger reconnects with his past, then looks to the future by passing on the cowboy way to four-year-old Matthew. While Bubba confides in Kaley that the cowboys are reevaluating their business, Cody gets bad news about his upcoming rodeo, which is even worse news for his bank account.</desc></programme><programme start="20250923180000 +0000" stop="20250923183000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Rifleman</title><desc>S1 E23 The Second Witness Lucas&apos; life is in danger after he agrees to testify in a murder case in another town.

The holidays are always hectic, but for cowboys it&apos;s especially busy because it&apos;s also calving season. Time for the birth of new baby calves to join the herd. Bubba, Cody, and Booger must monitor their heifers around the clock and still find time to shop for gifts, decorate for Christmas, and enjoy time with their families. Booger helps Matthew pick out an extra-special gift to top Grandma&apos;s Christmas tree. Cody looks to buy Carter the perfect cute new puppy. Kaley enlists the wives to help prepare for the Thompson&apos;s annual holiday party. But, when a heifer who&apos;s in labor goes missing one night, the cowboys frantically search for her while trying to keep from missing the big event.</desc></programme><programme start="20250924050000 +0000" stop="20250924060000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Cowboy Way</title><desc>S5 E1 Go Big or Go Broker Tough jobs and shady business deals force the cowboys to work smarter, not harder. A local rancher asks the guys to remove an ornery bull from his property, but this one is as bullheaded as they come - and takes longer than expected. Tired of scrapping for day wages, the cowboys decide to put their hard-earned experience to use: instead of working cattle for others, they&apos;ll start brokering herds themselves. After sifting through his grandmother&apos;s old photos, Booger reconnects with his past, then looks to the future by passing on the cowboy way to four-year-old Matthew. While Bubba confides in Kaley that the cowboys are reevaluating their business, Cody gets bad news about his upcoming rodeo, which is even worse news for his bank account.</desc></programme><programme start="20250924060000 +0000" stop="20250924063000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Rifleman</title><desc>S1 E23 The Second Witness Lucas&apos; life is in danger after he agrees to testify in a murder case in another town.
