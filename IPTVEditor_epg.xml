A local rancher asks the guys to remove an ornery bull from his property, but this one is as bullheaded as they come - and takes longer than expected. Tired of scrapping for day wages, the cowboys decide to put their hard-earned experience to use: instead of working cattle for others, they&apos;ll start brokering herds themselves. After sifting through his grandmother&apos;s old photos, Booger reconnects with his past, then looks to the future by passing on the cowboy way to four-year-old Matthew. While Bubba confides in Kaley that the cowboys are reevaluating their business, Cody gets bad news about his upcoming rodeo, which is even worse news for his bank account.</desc></programme><programme start="20250728170000 +0000" stop="20250728180000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Cowboy Way</title><desc>S5 E2 Don&apos;t Mess with Texas The cowboys head to Texas!

Misty also comes up with a potential rodeo venue, so Cody heads out to Bay Minette, AL to lock down a site. Bubba and Kaley prepare for houseguest Andrew&apos;s family to arrive. Will Andrew finally find his own place, and get out of Kaley&apos;s hair? Meanwhile, the guys&apos; reputation as cattle brokers starts to flourish. Booger gets a lead on a healthy herd of cattle in Texas, and the guys consider if they should go all-in and buy the entire herd. Booger heads back to the Lone Star State and strikes a deal that seems to be a win-win. But just as the guys get the ball rolling with another big deal, a phone call from their buyer puts everything in jeopardy.</desc></programme><programme start="20250801050000 +0000" stop="20250801060000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Cowboy Way</title><desc>S5 E8 Kiddie Corral The cowboys step a little outside of their comfort zones.
