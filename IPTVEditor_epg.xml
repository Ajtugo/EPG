Each link in the chain forms a compound word or phrase with the word before and/or after it.

The premise is simple: two teams try to complete chains of seven words. The first and last word in each chain are revealed, and the contestants must guess the missing words, with one letter being revealed each turn. Each link in the chain forms a compound word or phrase with the word before and/or after it. Teams earn money for each word they guess correctly, and the team with the most money at the end of the game goes on to the bonus round, dubbed the Super Chain, for a chance to add an additional $5,000 to the total the team won during the main part of the game.</desc></programme><programme start="20250312220000 +0000" stop="20250312223000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250312223000 +0000" stop="20250312230000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250312230000 +0000" stop="20250312233000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Switch</title><desc>Jeff Hephner challenges contestants who are ranked based on their answers to trivia questions for a chance at $10,000; every question counts, as each answer can propel them to the top or to the bottom, where they&apos;ll be in jeopardy of elimination.</desc></programme><programme start="20250312233000 +0000" stop="20250313000000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Split Second</title><desc>John Michael Higgins presents three contestants with a question and three possible choices and whoever buzzes in fastest earns the right to answer first.</desc></programme><programme start="20250313000000 +0000" stop="20250313010000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>The Wall</title><desc>Everyday people battle a variety of trivia questions and a 40-foot wall for a chance to win millions of dollars.

The premise is simple: two teams try to complete chains of seven words. The first and last word in each chain are revealed, and the contestants must guess the missing words, with one letter being revealed each turn. Each link in the chain forms a compound word or phrase with the word before and/or after it. Teams earn money for each word they guess correctly, and the team with the most money at the end of the game goes on to the bonus round, dubbed the Super Chain, for a chance to add an additional $5,000 to the total the team won during the main part of the game.</desc></programme><programme start="20250313220000 +0000" stop="20250313223000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250313223000 +0000" stop="20250313230000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250313230000 +0000" stop="20250313233000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Switch</title><desc>Jeff Hephner challenges contestants who are ranked based on their answers to trivia questions for a chance at $10,000; every question counts, as each answer can propel them to the top or to the bottom, where they&apos;ll be in jeopardy of elimination.</desc></programme><programme start="20250313233000 +0000" stop="20250314000000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Split Second</title><desc>John Michael Higgins presents three contestants with a question and three possible choices and whoever buzzes in fastest earns the right to answer first.</desc></programme><programme start="20250314000000 +0000" stop="20250314010000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>The Wall</title><desc>Everyday people battle a variety of trivia questions and a 40-foot wall for a chance to win millions of dollars.

But in the late 1800s, the nation&apos;s buffalo were nearly wiped out by ruthless hide hunters. Those majestic herds, which once numbered in the tens of millions, were down to less than 500 animals. This is the story of the handful of determined men and women who mobilized to save the ones that were left in a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction. Ranchers like Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight rescued orphaned buffalo calves and built small herds. Former buffalo hunters like Buffalo Bill helped build public sympathy. And politicians like Theodore Roosevelt helped pass laws to protect the remaining animals. The effort would be a generational one, with buffalo herds carefully tended, bred, and passed down to new stewards when their old protectors passed away. Thanks to their efforts, there are an estimated 500,000 buffalo thundering across America&apos;s grasslands once again.</desc></programme><programme start="20250310100000 +0000" stop="20250310112000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>High Lonesome</title><desc>A sudden and swift series of murders occurs in southwestern Texas, sending Big Bend country into a frenzy.

But in the late 1800s, the nation&apos;s buffalo were nearly wiped out by ruthless hide hunters. Those majestic herds, which once numbered in the tens of millions, were down to less than 500 animals. This is the story of the handful of determined men and women who mobilized to save the ones that were left in a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction. Ranchers like Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight rescued orphaned buffalo calves and built small herds. Former buffalo hunters like Buffalo Bill helped build public sympathy. And politicians like Theodore Roosevelt helped pass laws to protect the remaining animals. The effort would be a generational one, with buffalo herds carefully tended, bred, and passed down to new stewards when their old protectors passed away. Thanks to their efforts, there are an estimated 500,000 buffalo thundering across America&apos;s grasslands once again.</desc></programme><programme start="20250310100000 +0000" stop="20250310112000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>High Lonesome</title><desc>A sudden and swift series of murders occurs in southwestern Texas, sending Big Bend country into a frenzy.

After months of tracking Doolin, Heck Thomas is so close he barely stops to eat or sleep. When Thomas and his posse finally corner Doolin, he refuses to surrender, and gunfire is the only way out.

Years later, when legendary gunfighter-turned-newspaperman Bat Masterson tries to do a piece on Charlie, he quickly realizes that he must first deal with the woman behind the famous cowboy artist Charles M.
