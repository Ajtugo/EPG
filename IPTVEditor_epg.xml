However, if wisdom comes to those who face extreme adversity surely Toyota must be wise well beyond their years. With just three minutes left in the race after 24 hours of racing the new Toyota TS050 hybrid looked set for a sensational debut win – until fate stepped in. The official twitter account summed up the feeling with just one word: “Heartbroken”. Ford managed the feat of a debut victory with their new GT in the LMGTE Pro class, fifty years after the first win of the famous GT40. With weather playing a role, once more, and a fiercely competitive field of evenly matched machines and drivers, the stage was set for a dramatic race and the reality didn’t disappoint.</desc></programme><programme start="20250719000000 +0000" stop="20250719010000 +0000" channel="bloombergtv.us"><title>Bloomberg Investigates</title><desc>Rainbow Mountain offers tourists a picture-perfect view that has flooded social media feeds; behind this viral beauty spot is the story of a community at war, cries for help ignored and murder.</desc></programme><programme start="20250719010000 +0000" stop="20250719013000 +0000" channel="bloombergtv.us"><title>The David Rubenstein Show: Peer to Peer Conversations</title><desc>Financier and philanthropist David Rubenstein talks with his peers - leaders of some of America&apos;s biggest companies - in this interview show that aims to answer the question of what makes a great leader; Rubenstein uses his chats to explore successful leadership skills through the personal and professional choices made by the business world&apos;s most influential people; Rubenstein travels across the country to find out about the business leaders&apos; stories and uncover information about their paths to success; the interview subjects include Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett and Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi.</desc></programme><programme start="20250719013000 +0000" stop="20250719020000 +0000" channel="bloombergtv.us"><title>Bloomberg Originals</title><desc>Experts offer bold takes on some of today&apos;s most important topics and cover stories and investigations at the intersection of business and culture.</desc></programme><programme start="20250719020000 +0000" stop="20250719030000 +0000" channel="bloombergtv.us"><title>Bloomberg Wall Street Week</title><desc>A weekly program telling the stories of capitalism from around the world, David Westin in New York hosts.</desc></programme><programme start="20250719030000 +0000" stop="20250719033000 +0000" channel="bloombergtv.us"><title>Bloomberg Next Africa</title><desc>A monthly deep dive into Africa&apos;s biggest stories through a Bloomberg lens.

Now down to ten cowboys, the competition continues with an all-new immunity challenge that focuses on a whole different aspect of cowboyin&apos; - business acumen. The contestants must prove they know the cattle market by estimating the value of various livestock at auction. Trace asks the contestants to continue to train the colts from the last elimination challenge, but they struggle to develop a plan that will work for everyone. The elimination challenge tests the contestants&apos; team strategy, roping, and speed. Each team has forty-five minutes to collect fifteen gold ear tags from mixed herds in two different pastures. Frustrations build when the green team has trouble with the pens, and a cow escapes during the blue team&apos;s run. As the competition intensifies, one cowboy tries to get rid of his biggest competition. Unimpressed by how the teams handled the challenge, Trace shakes things up by sending two cowboys home.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718110000 +0000" stop="20250718120000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>The Young Riders</title><desc>S2 E3 Dead Ringer A gunman impersonating Jimmy as Wild Bill Hickok, robs banks in the territory.

At a time when only ten percent of physicians are female, Dr. Anderson faces her share of doubters and has a difficult time attracting patients in the frontier town. When miners suddenly rush into her office with an injured boy, she defies prevailing wisdom and decides to save his mangled arm instead of amputating the limb. The risks are enormous. If the boy&apos;s arm becomes infected, and he dies, she will lose everything. Years later, Dr. Anderson relives the story while treating Bat Masterson, legendary gunfighter-turned-newspaperman, who comes down with fever while passing through Cripple Creek.</desc></programme><programme start="20250720092900 +0000" stop="20250720100000 +0000" channel="westernbound.us"><title>Wild West Chronicles</title><desc>S3 E2 Billy the Kid: Birth of an Outlaw Teenaged fugitive William Bonney is given a second chance when a kindhearted ranch owner offers him a job.

The premise is simple: two teams try to complete chains of seven words. The first and last word in each chain are revealed, and the contestants must guess the missing words, with one letter being revealed each turn. Each link in the chain forms a compound word or phrase with the word before and/or after it. Teams earn money for each word they guess correctly, and the team with the most money at the end of the game goes on to the bonus round, dubbed the Super Chain, for a chance to add an additional $5,000 to the total the team won during the main part of the game.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717220000 +0000" stop="20250717223000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717223000 +0000" stop="20250717230000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717230000 +0000" stop="20250717233000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Tic Tac Dough</title><desc>Two contestants compete to place three marks in a row on trivia board avoiding a dragon that can steal turns; the winner faces the dragon in a final round where it blocks three-in-a-row attempts to prevent the $10,000 prize win.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717233000 +0000" stop="20250718000000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Bingo Blitz</title><desc>Contestants compete in a dynamic blend of trivia and bingo.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718000000 +0000" stop="20250718010000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>The Wall</title><desc>Two cousins vie for the prize.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718010000 +0000" stop="20250718020000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Press Your Luck</title><desc>Contestants from Sri Lanka, Oxnard, Calif., and Chicago, Ill.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718020000 +0000" stop="20250718023000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718023000 +0000" stop="20250718030000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718030000 +0000" stop="20250718033000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718033000 +0000" stop="20250718040000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718040000 +0000" stop="20250718043000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718043000 +0000" stop="20250718050000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Flip Side</title><desc>The hilarious new survey game show explores answers to questions from differing perspectives; host Jaleel White.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718050000 +0000" stop="20250718053000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Wheel of Fortune</title><desc>In a classic game-show version of &quot;Hangman,&quot; contestants solve word puzzles for cash and prizes.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718053000 +0000" stop="20250718060000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Switch</title><desc>Jeff Hephner challenges contestants who are ranked based on their answers to trivia questions for a chance at $10,000; every question counts, as each answer can propel them to the top or to the bottom, where they&apos;ll be in jeopardy of elimination.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718060000 +0000" stop="20250718063000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>People Puzzler</title><desc>Three contestants put their pop culture knowledge to the test to complete crosswords based on the iconic puzzles in People magazine.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718063000 +0000" stop="20250718070000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718070000 +0000" stop="20250718073000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718073000 +0000" stop="20250718080000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Stapleton Family vs. Fountain Family.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718080000 +0000" stop="20250718083000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Freedom to Leave the House!

The premise is simple: two teams try to complete chains of seven words. The first and last word in each chain are revealed, and the contestants must guess the missing words, with one letter being revealed each turn. Each link in the chain forms a compound word or phrase with the word before and/or after it. Teams earn money for each word they guess correctly, and the team with the most money at the end of the game goes on to the bonus round, dubbed the Super Chain, for a chance to add an additional $5,000 to the total the team won during the main part of the game.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717220000 +0000" stop="20250717223000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717223000 +0000" stop="20250717230000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Beat the Bridge</title><desc>An interactive bridge dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions; each step forward puts money in the team&apos;s bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717230000 +0000" stop="20250717233000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Tic Tac Dough</title><desc>Two contestants compete to place three marks in a row on trivia board avoiding a dragon that can steal turns; the winner faces the dragon in a final round where it blocks three-in-a-row attempts to prevent the $10,000 prize win.</desc></programme><programme start="20250717233000 +0000" stop="20250718000000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Bingo Blitz</title><desc>Contestants compete in a dynamic blend of trivia and bingo.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718000000 +0000" stop="20250718010000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>The Wall</title><desc>Two cousins vie for the prize.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718010000 +0000" stop="20250718020000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Press Your Luck</title><desc>Contestants from Sri Lanka, Oxnard, Calif., and Chicago, Ill.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718020000 +0000" stop="20250718023000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718023000 +0000" stop="20250718030000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718030000 +0000" stop="20250718033000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718033000 +0000" stop="20250718040000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718040000 +0000" stop="20250718043000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718043000 +0000" stop="20250718050000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Flip Side</title><desc>The hilarious new survey game show explores answers to questions from differing perspectives; host Jaleel White.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718050000 +0000" stop="20250718053000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Wheel of Fortune</title><desc>In a classic game-show version of &quot;Hangman,&quot; contestants solve word puzzles for cash and prizes.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718053000 +0000" stop="20250718060000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Switch</title><desc>Jeff Hephner challenges contestants who are ranked based on their answers to trivia questions for a chance at $10,000; every question counts, as each answer can propel them to the top or to the bottom, where they&apos;ll be in jeopardy of elimination.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718060000 +0000" stop="20250718063000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>People Puzzler</title><desc>Three contestants put their pop culture knowledge to the test to complete crosswords based on the iconic puzzles in People magazine.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718063000 +0000" stop="20250718070000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718070000 +0000" stop="20250718073000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey hosts; two families compete to guess the answers to various surveys.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718073000 +0000" stop="20250718080000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Stapleton Family vs. Fountain Family.</desc></programme><programme start="20250718080000 +0000" stop="20250718083000 +0000" channel="gsn.us"><title>Freedom to Leave the House!

This is the story of the handful of determined men and women who mobilized to save the ones that were left in a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction. Ranchers like Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight rescued orphaned buffalo calves and built small herds. Former buffalo hunters like Buffalo Bill helped build public sympathy. And politicians like Theodore Roosevelt helped pass laws to protect the remaining animals. The effort would be a generational one, with buffalo herds carefully tended, bred, and passed down to new stewards when their old protectors passed away.

However, if wisdom comes to those who face extreme adversity surely Toyota must be wise well beyond their years. With just three minutes left in the race after 24 hours of racing the new Toyota TS050 hybrid looked set for a sensational debut win – until fate stepped in. The official twitter account summed up the feeling with just one word: “Heartbroken”. Ford managed the feat of a debut victory with their new GT in the LMGTE Pro class, fifty years after the first win of the famous GT40. With weather playing a role, once more, and a fiercely competitive field of evenly matched machines and drivers, the stage was set for a dramatic race and the reality didn’t disappoint.</desc></programme><programme start="20250719000000 +0000" stop="20250719010000 +0000" channel="bloombergtv.us"><title>Bloomberg Investigates</title><desc>Rainbow Mountain offers tourists a picture-perfect view that has flooded social media feeds; behind this viral beauty spot is the story of a community at war, cries for help ignored and murder.</desc></programme><programme start="20250719010000 +0000" stop="20250719013000 +0000" channel="bloombergtv.us"><title>The David Rubenstein Show: Peer to Peer Conversations</title><desc>Financier and philanthropist David Rubenstein talks with his peers - leaders of some of America&apos;s biggest companies - in this interview show that aims to answer the question of what makes a great leader; Rubenstein uses his chats to explore successful leadership skills through the personal and professional choices made by the business world&apos;s most influential people; Rubenstein travels across the country to find out about the business leaders&apos; stories and uncover information about their paths to success; the interview subjects include Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett and Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi.</desc></programme><programme start="20250719013000 +0000" stop="20250719020000 +0000" channel="bloombergtv.us"><title>Bloomberg Originals</title><desc>Experts offer bold takes on some of today&apos;s most important topics and cover stories and investigations at the intersection of business and culture.</desc></programme><programme start="20250719020000 +0000" stop="20250719030000 +0000" channel="bloombergtv.us"><title>Bloomberg Wall Street Week</title><desc>A weekly program telling the stories of capitalism from around the world, David Westin in New York hosts.</desc></programme><programme start="20250719030000 +0000" stop="20250719033000 +0000" channel="bloombergtv.us"><title>Bloomberg Next Africa</title><desc>A monthly deep dive into Africa&apos;s biggest stories through a Bloomberg lens.
